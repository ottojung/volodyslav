# Entries – Comprehensive System Overview

This document provides a concept-level map of how "entries" (user events) interact with and traverse the backend system—covering ingestion, processing, storage, retrieval, cross-cutting services, and lifecycle concerns.

## 1. System Entry Points

Entries can originate from multiple interfaces:

- **Command-Line Interface**  
  Lightweight CLI for local workflows; boots HTTP server or handles simple entry commands.

- **HTTP API**  
  REST endpoints enable remote clients to create and list entries. File uploads and raw text requests flow through common parsing and storage logic.

- **Automated & Batch Processes**  
  - Scheduled jobs scan or generate entries (e.g., periodic reminders, diary audio processing).  
  - Webhooks or AI pipelines (transcription, classification) create or augment entries asynchronously.

## 2. Shared Capabilities & Initialization

A unified **Capabilities** object binds together:

- Environment & Configuration (paths, ports, feature flags)  
- Structured Logging & Monitoring (entry events, errors, metrics)  
- Filesystem Interfaces (reader, writer, appender, checker, deleter, copier)  
- Unique ID Generation & Seeding  
- Version Control (Git-backed commits for audit)  
- Scheduling Engine & Notifier Service  
- AI Enrichment (transcription, analysis)  
- Datetime Utilities (consistent timestamping)

Server startup ensures all systems (env, storage backends, notifier, scheduler, Git repo) are primed before handling entry traffic.

## 3. Ingestion & Validation

- **Input Sources**  
  Raw text (CLI), JSON payloads (API), and multipart uploads funnel through common middleware.
- **Parsing Engine**  
  Normalizes input to an internal schema, handling multiple entry types and modifiers.
- **Validation**  
  Early rejection of malformed data (missing description, invalid date, bad modifiers) with clear client errors.

## 4. Core Domain Logic & Specialized Flows

- **Entry Factory**  
  Assigns unique ID, resolves date, and tags with creating subsystem.
- **Specialized Handlers**  
  - Diary entries may invoke audio transcription tasks.  
  - Task or reminder types might schedule follow-up jobs.  
  - Custom types can plug into this factory to extend behavior.
- **Asset Linking**  
  Associates uploaded or referenced files with entries, producing immutable asset descriptors.

## 5. Durability & Pluggable Storage

- **Transactional Event Log**  
  All entry writes (and linked assets) occur within atomic transactions, ensuring consistency or rollback.
- **Versioned Backends**  
  Support for append-only JSON streams, databases, or Git-backed repositories for audit, history, and diff-driven workflows.
- **Retrieval Interface**  
  Unified query layer provides pagination, filtering, and cursor-based navigation for large datasets.

## 6. Asset Lifecycle Management

- **Creation**  upon entry ingestion.  
- **Retention & Cleanup**  policies determine when assets become orphaned or are archived.  
- **Deletion**  cascades or manual pruning remove assets from storage and log.

## 7. Cross-Cutting Integrations

- **Logging & Observability**  
  Entry lifecycle emits structured logs and metrics, enabling tracing and health monitoring.
- **Error Handling**  
  Centralized error middleware differentiates client faults (validation) from system failures (storage, dependencies), with structured alerts.
- **Notifications & Alerts**  
  New or updated entries can trigger email/push notifications or escalate via external channels.
- **Scheduling Hooks**  
  Periodic or delayed tasks consume entries (for reminders, summaries) and may update entry state.
- **AI/Transcription Pipelines**  
  Media attachments can feed AI services to auto-generate transcripts or enrich metadata.

## 8. Security & Access Control

- **Authentication & Authorization**  
  Gate entry creation and retrieval based on user roles and scopes.
- **Input Sanitization**  
  Prevent injection attacks by validating and escaping entry content and file metadata.
- **File Validation**  
  Enforce upload size, type restrictions, and virus scanning for attachments.

## 9. Performance & Scalability

- **Pagination Strategies**  
  Avoid large in-memory scans by employing cursors or indexed queries.
- **Storage Sharding**  
  Distribute event logs across partitions or services for high throughput.
- **Caching**  
  Layer results or metadata to reduce repeated storage reads.

## 10. Testing & Quality Assurance

- **Unit Tests**  
  Cover parsing rules, core factory logic, and storage interactions.  
- **Integration Tests**  
  Validate end-to-end flows through API, storage, and auxiliary services (scheduler, notifier).  
- **Mock Repositories**  
  Simulate versioned storage to test transactional guarantees.  
- **Fault Injection**  
  Verify resilience by simulating errors in dependencies (filesystem, Git, AI services).

## 11. Configuration & Environment

- **Feature Flags**  
  Toggle new entry types or pipelines without redeploying code.  
- **Storage Settings**  
  Configure backend type, retention policies, and path locations.  
- **Security Settings**  
  Define authentication providers, rate limits, and access control rules.

## 12. Lifecycle & Cleanup

- **Entry Deletion**  
  Soft or hard delete semantics, with optional archival for compliance.  
- **Audit Trails**  
  Maintain immutable logs of create/update/delete actions for governance.  
- **Data Retention**  
  Automated purge based on age or policy, impacting both entries and assets.

## 13. Extension & Customization

- **Parser Plugins**  
  Add or override parsing rules for new entry types and modifiers.  
- **Storage Adapters**  
  Implement custom backends (NoSQL, distributed logs) by conforming to the transaction API.  
- **Lifecycle Hooks**  
  Insert custom logic at key points (pre-create, post-retrieve, on-delete) for auditing or replication.
