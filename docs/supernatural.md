However, it should be written in the style of Lovecraft.
It conveys dread, helplessness.
It is reality-bending in some places.
There is lots of uncanny and the unsettling.
It is grave, meticulous, humor only implicit, investigator fraying at the edges.

## Prologue

I was not trained for hauntings. I was trained for reproducibility, for test plans and postmortems, for the clean relief of a failing unit test that fails again in the same way. But the longer I have tended systems—their valves and logs, their hissing racks and their fragile promises—the more I have come to understand that what we write on paper is not what the air will carry.

<PLACEHOLDER/>

I began to keep a dossier. Not a taxonomy—God preserve me from one more axis—but a sheaf of field notes: cases gathered from labs and basements, control rooms and attics <PLACEHOLDER/>. A few I saw myself; others I learned from steadier hands who were there before me

### I. The Schaerbeek Bit

**Schaerbeek, Belgium.**

<NOTE>
This is a made-up story of how the Shaerbeek incident happened.
There is a documented part, which is included at the end.
But the main piece is the made-up horror story.

---

It was told to us by a technician who had been there.
Let us sit with him in a cafeteria - that's how we hear the story.
The story should start with description of how we met the technician, and what kind of person he was.
We should describe the cafeteria, too, the technician's character, his mannerisms, etc.

</NOTE>

<TODO>
Improve the following opening paragraph.
Tie to an important event that happend during that day.
Example: 10 Sep 2008 — First beam sent around CERN’s Large Hadron Collider. If you want a wink toward particles, randomness, and tiny events with outsized consequences.
</TODO>

I am in a cafeteria in Schaerbeek, just off the tram line, waiting for a man who is late. In unfamiliar rooms I begin, out of habit, by checking how they are arranged.

The windows sit low; from inside, the passing traffic moves along the upper edge of the view like a slow, mechanical ceiling. The tables keep the same measured distance from the walls, aisles just wide enough for a tray to pass without contact; the chairs face each other in pairs, every seat already assigned its opposite whether occupied or not. The queue bends once before the till in an L-shape that keeps the doorway clear.

I take my place in it, moving forward in small, regular steps each time the drawer opens with its tired ring. Above the counter, three menus are printed in two tight columns; when my turn comes I trust the digits more than the words and repeat one of the numbers, watching the cashier’s hand go straight to the corresponding row as if confirming a mapping I had only guessed at. Tray in hand, I follow the polished path in the tiles to a table by the wall, where two chairs stand across a rectangle of wiped laminate.

I sit facing the empty chair and wait, noticing how the room seems complete except for the single absence across from me.

<NOTE>
Below we describe the technician who arrives, his character, mannerisms, etc.
Use these:
- "He worked elections—“not politics,” he said quickly, “interfaces.”".
- "... a habit of tapping the table as though confirming liveness.".
- "He used the word spontaneous without liking it."
</NOTE>

He arrives at the point where waiting has become a kind of agreement with the empty chair. He stands at the edge of the table for a moment, as if checking that the setting matches a description he has been given, then sits without asking whether this is the right place.

We exchange the usual confirmations—my name, his, the fact that we have both found the correct café in the correct district on the correct day. He worked elections—“not politics,” he said quickly, “interfaces.” As he speaks he keeps straightening small things—the sugar packet, the spoon—returning between sentences to tapping the table, as though confirming liveness.

<TODO>
Improve the following paragraph. The goal is to show that technician dislikes "surprizes".
</TODO>

I mention a delay on the tram. He nods and says there had been “a spontaneous adjustment to the route,” then falls briefly silent, as if the phrase does not belong to him. He used the word "spontaneous" without liking it.

<NOTE>
The goal of the part below is to show the misalignment between the narrator and the technician.
</NOTE>

We had been sitting for some time, our coffees cooling to the same shade of resignation, when he reached for the complimentary biscuits on the saucer. He studied them briefly — two, wrapped together in cellophane — and then said, as if concluding a long experiment, “You can tell a lot about a nation from how its biscuits break.”

I looked at him. “How they break?”

He nodded, tapping the packet against the table. “You see, the English ones surrender at the middle. The French fracture elegantly, as if it were part of the design. Belgian biscuits, though — they resist until you lose interest.”

I considered the claim, uncertain whether to take it as metaphor or field observation. “Perhaps,” I said finally, “the composition differs.”

He smiled faintly, unwrapping them. “No, it’s temperament. The dough remembers its upbringing.”

He broke one biscuit; it split unevenly, half crumbling onto the napkin. He seemed pleased. “See? The kind of nation that tolerates asymmetry but not waste.”

I reached for the other biscuit, broke it deliberately down the middle. “That one was symmetrical,” I observed.

“Outlier,” he said, already eating the first. “There are always outliers.”

I wanted to ask whether he was speaking of nations or of biscuits, but it felt too pedantic to clarify and too absurd not to. Instead I stirred my coffee and said, “Quality control, perhaps.”

He looked genuinely impressed. “Exactly,” he said, as though I had finally joined the conversation he’d been having alone.

For a moment we both ate in silence, the fragments softening in the coffee.

He watched the room with the same concentration he had given to their fracture, as if the café itself were being tested for compliance.

“When people talk about elections,” he said at last, “they always mean the result. They don’t talk about the day itself.”

This sounded like an opening for another small theory, ballots behaving like biscuits, perhaps. I kept myself from nodding or asking questions, trying not to indulge him this time. But he continued, the way one continues a form onto the next page because there is no space left on the first.

“I worked one day,” he said, “that stayed with me more than the result it produced.”

<FIXME>
In the following paragraph, instead of having narrator "file the incident", he should learn about it from somewhere else. Do not assume he had any connection to the story itself beyond merely hearing about it. Maybe in rumors only.
</FIXME>
<DRAFT>
He mentioned a school in Schaerbeek, a federal election, a machine that misbihaved. I recognised the outline before he finished the sentence. Years earlier I had filed the incident away under the comforting label computer error, a newspaper curiosity had appeared and then been explained. It took me a moment to adjust to the idea that the man across from me had been inside the room I had imagined only from reports.
</DRAFT>

<TODO>
Fix the following. It should be simpler and contain "He did not tell it in order, but I will".
</TODO>
<DRAFT>
He did not tell it as a story. He circled it, doubling back, supplying conditions and side remarks as they occurred to him. For my own sanity I will lay it out the way a checklist would have preferred it: in an order that suggests the day was meant to proceed.
</DRAFT>

<TODO>
In the following paragraph add the carpet introduction, "... a carpet whose pattern is an argument against democracy.". It should strictly be mentioned as the last object in an enumeration of the voting hall's objects.
</TODO>
<DRAFT>
The polling station was a school. Its walls still carried faded posters about hygiene and primary colours, but the doors had been re-labelled with printed arrows and neutral nouns: Entrance, Exit, Polling Room. ...
</DRAFT>

He had been sent there as technician, a word expansive enough to cover whatever had not yet been assigned to the others. On his table lay the checklist: confirm serial numbers, confirm counters at zero, confirm seals intact; note every confirmation in ink, sign where indicated. Behind him, near the door, two party representatives occupied metal chairs with the air of people who had been told to observe “the process” and were still waiting for the process to begin. A third watcher, a schoolteacher seconded for the day, stood where she could see both the machines and the clerks and seemed unsure which of them constituted the real work.

<NOTE>Notes, thoughts, and suggestions for the new paragraph below:

**Purpose:** Bridge from the static "waiting room" tableau to the procedural rhythm of voting. Show the day beginning in earnest, but maintain the flat, observational tone. No unease yet—this is still Beat A/B territory.

**Themes to reinforce:**
- The choreography of democratic process as mechanical ritual
- The gap between the symbolic weight of voting and its mundane execution
- The technician's role as silent custodian of a system he doesn't fully own

**Suggestions for variation:**
1. Could add a small detail about the first voter (elderly? hesitant? overly confident?) to humanize the machinery
2. Could mention the technician checking something on the machine as the first vote is cast—a small ritual of his own
3. Could hint at the dry atmosphere (foreshadowing the "tonight is dry" line) through a mention of static, or someone's hair, or paper crackling

**Potential expansion points:**
- The phrase "as if confirming a translation" could be developed into a longer meditation on the gap between intention and record
- The mention of the machine's sound could echo the later "identifying birds" line from the schoolteacher

**Tone check:** Keep it procedural and uncolored. No metaphors yet. The prose should feel like a form being filled out—correct, neutral, waiting.
</NOTE>

The doors opened at eight. Voters arrived in the hesitant rhythm of early morning, each one checked against the register, handed a card, directed to a booth. The technician watched the first ballot cast: a woman who studied the screen for longer than the instructions required, then pressed confirm with a small nod, as if confirming a translation rather than a choice. The machine accepted it without comment. Its sound—a brief, administrative hum—was the only evidence that anything had been recorded at all.

By noon the rhythm had settled into something approaching routine. The clerks called numbers from their lists; voters stepped forward when summoned; the booths filled and emptied in orderly succession. The technician made his rounds between the machines, checking displays that showed nothing more interesting than incremental counts. Each device performed its assigned function: accept input, record choice, advance counter. The party watchers had grown comfortable enough to exchange small talk about the weather—dry for May, they agreed, unusually so.

<NOTE>
Make the moment of discovery feel like a slow bruise rather than a jump scare.

Stance: Treat the error as felt before it is known. Avoid any instant revelation; delay the noun “4096” and delay “power of two” until later.

Method: Build unease through procedural rhythm going out of tune: call-and-response totals, the small pauses people make when they pretend they didn’t pause, the re-addition that wasn’t requested but nobody objects to.

Rule: All uncanny pressure must be deniable as normal fatigue or habit. Nothing “happens”; only confidence fails to materialize.

No lights flicker; no sudden silence; no person “feels watched.” The room remains ordinary. The wrongness is procedural.

Do not let “4096” appear near exclamation or italics. Refuse emphasis; that refusal is the chill.

Do not explain why they re-add. Let habit and unease motivate it; explanation breaks the spell.

---

Do: When you finally print the digits, bury them.
Stage: “…leaving, as a remainder, 4 096, which—” and immediately continue with process. No italics, no em dash flourish.
Buys: The number feels cold and procedural, not performative.

---

During the discovery phase, employ "procedural time dilation" technique:

Do: Mark tiny time with objects, not timestamps.
Stage: Uncapped pen dries on the nib; a condensation ring appears under a disposable cup; the adding tape’s curl advances by one more loop—each coinciding with a re-add.
Buys: The room’s time moves, not the plot’s.

---

Going into the technician’s story:

Make the transition clear. Begin the transition with a sentence like "He told it not in order, but I will."

Start innocently, matter-of-fact. Only when the tally reaches the faulty candidate does the prose admit weather/dryness and begin the drift into unease.

Structure:
1) **Beat A — Ordinary Room, Ordinary Building (no unease, no weather).**  
2) **Beat B — Ordinary Process (procedural, uncolored).**  
3) **Beat C — Pivot on the Candidate (introduce weather/dryness; first sideways detail).**  
4) **Beat D — Residual Unease (subtle sensory misfits; still deniable).**

Rules:
- **A & B:** strictly operational; zero metaphors; no “dry,” no “thirteen,” no carpet opinions.  
- **C:** first mention of weather/dryness; remain clinical; allow one sensory adjective.  
- **D:** 1–2 oddities total; plausible as fatigue or static; no overt horror language.

---

When discovering the error make it seem like everyone understood, without agreement, that to call it an error would start the machinery of inquiry—forms, witnesses, the freezing of work already half done. So make them speak around it instead, referring to *this part* or *that total*, passing the word as if it burned.

</NOTE>

<MUST HAVES>
Another bit that shows the misalignment between the narrator and the technician:

The waiter left the bill between us and moved on without a word.
He looked at it for a moment, then said, “You know what cafés should do? Add a line for conversation quality. Like a service rating, but mandatory. You’d tip more if you’d actually learned something.”

I thought he was joking, but he kept going.
“They could print a small scale at the bottom,” he said, sketching in the air. “Zero for silence, ten for revelations. You fill it in yourself. Encourages improvement.”

I unfolded the bill. “That’s unworkable,” I said.
“Why?”
“The staff can’t verify it.”
“They don’t verify taste either,” he said. “You could hate the soup and still pay for flavor.”

He seemed genuinely interested in the logistics.
“They’d need categories,” he went on. “Depth, originality, politeness—maybe a subtotal for wit. It could revolutionize small talk.”

I set the paper flat against the table, aligning it with the grain. “That’s not how cafés operate,” I said.
He smiled faintly. “Not yet.”

There was a pause — long enough to feel like he was waiting for me to solve his idea.
Finally, I said, “No.”

Not loud, but enough.
He blinked once, almost surprised, then nodded as if I’d supplied the missing metric.

When the waiter returned, I left the money neatly folded inside the bill. He added a coin, uncalled for.

"... a carpet whose pattern is an argument against democracy." - for the part describing the polling station.

Smell/sound texture of “dry athmosphere" when describing the surrounding of the polling station. This is to echo the “Not tonight… tonight is dry.” line.

"There is the certainty, never admitted aloud, that somewhere a check is missing and that this is sane; that checks go missing the way buttons go missing from coats." - for the part that leads to the discovery of the anomaly.

"It was one power of two too proud." - when first referring to the extra votes (4096 = 2^12).

"The list’s ceiling is the candidate’s sky, and yet there it was: sky lower than the bird:

$$\boxed{\text{candidate preferences } \leq \text{ party list total } \leq \text{ district total}}$$", titled "Invariant 1. (violated)".

"They stared at the sum as though it might amend itself out of shame." - for the part describing the clerks discovering the extra votes.

"One of the watchers—a schoolteacher—tried to be helpful by pointing out each time the computer made a small sound, as if identifying birds." - for the part describing the immediate on-site investigation.

"The woman with the tape asked if lightning could do it. “Not tonight,” said the toolbox man; “tonight is dry.”" - for the part describing the immediate on-site investigation.

"They made a ledger of what would be convenient to blame and crossed each item off." - for the part describing the immediate on-site investigation. A latex-styled checklist would be good here, each item crossed out.

"A physicist friend—pressed into service because her apartment was nearby, and because she is the sort of person one calls about the moon—arrived with a bicycle helmet and a theory that lay uneasily between farce and fate." - for the part describing the immediate on-site investigation.

"The bit toggled to one, and in so toggling, wove its one-ness into every arithmetic that followed." - when summarizing the conclusion of the physicist's theory.

"There was no smoking gun — only a single flip where a zero had become a one at the thirteenth bit, a neat, round power-of-two crime."

"Field Note #${X}. Horror, in our trade, is the clean error—the one that leaves no prints."

Clerks’ fatigue truth: a clerk privately prefers a boring human mistake; the cosmic explanation feels like trespass. But he knows better than to say so aloud, for one: he might be held legible for the error himself. This part, however, should resonate with some skeptic readers.

"A cosmic flea bite, the newspapers preferred." - for the part describing the official explanation.

"The committee’s report is less romantic, but it permits the word that haunts this dossier: likely. A likely single-event upset—an ion that fell through the evening and made a number grow teeth."

"The phrase is correct in the way that shipwrecks are wet." - when describing the official explanation.

Something like a related human-story about corruption:
The technician, having confessed to me the soft doctrine of the bit, told me a smaller, meaner story. The following week, a man from the party that had briefly prospered came into the municipal building with a cigar he did not light. He made a show of not lighting it; this was his signature, he said—good manners doubling as advertisement. He asked, in a tone so gentle it barely bruised the air, whether the numbers—those numbers—could be verified just one more time.

Then, a come-back to the technical part, to its conclusion/reflection.

"He meant, I think, that we must act as if the world intends this sort of interruption, because the world does not intend otherwise." - when reflecting on the technician's story.

An allegory that compares the unpredictability of software behavior to the weather. Something like "we do not fight the weather, we prepare for it."

"... if you believe in preparation, then you believe in a cathedral of checks where each arch braces another—triplicate logic, parity with scrubbing, watchdogs to guard the watchdogs, and the prophylactic act of voting in paper because paper fails like a person fails, slow and legible." - a counter-point to the weather allegory, and whatever the technician said.

"[poureva.be][2]" - link to the official report, for the reference section.

"The Schaerbeek incident occurred during Belgium’s federal election on Sunday, 18 May 2003, when one candidate was credited with 4,096 extra preferential votes—detected because the candidate’s preferences exceeded the party’s list total, an impossibility in that system. The official explanation described a “spontaneous creation of a bit at position 13” in memory; a widely cited interpretation is a single-event upset (SEU) likely caused by a cosmic ray." - for the reference section.

<NOTE>
Tie the ending of the Schaerbeek story to the Mark II moth example.
They are very similar stories.
Only the Schaerbeek one should be its own section, the Mark II moth should be a smaller comment.
</NOTE>

There is a photograph I keep in a folder called *Proofs I Do Not Argue With*. In it, a moth—an ordinary, grieving moth—sits dead-eyed on rag paper.

### II. The Heisenbug I Failed to Catch

<FIXME>
Change the title to something more evocative.
</FIXME>

<NOTE>
It would be nice to link to an actual report of someone who noticed an interesting or unique Heisenbug and how they diagnosed it. The story should then just be a retelling of that, with some embellishment. The story should not end with fixing the bug - it should portray the bug as something **real**, some kind of metaphysical phenomena that makes the system misbehave when it is not being observed.
</NOTE>

**Somewhere between midnight and the first ferry.**

### III. Maxwell’s Demon

<NOTE>
Tell a made up story about a state that is extremely unlikely, though possible, to happen, but did happen. 
For example, an MD5 hash collision.

Then, add a legend that one of the developers saw a large, terrifying demon that appeared to him in a dream, and that demon told him that the server room is cursed.

Ideally, find a real world example of something extremely unlikely happening, and use that as the basis for the story.
 </NOTE>

### IV. The Leprechaun of Off-by-One

<NOTE>
Tell a made up story of how actual Leprechaun from Irish folklore broke into the server room at night and "moved the loop bounds" (loop as in "a for-loop") by one.

This should be a story told to us by as a legend. In that legend, somebody allegedly, saw an actual small man in green clothes with a red beard in the server room.
</NOTE>

---

### V. Mercury in Retrograde

<NOTE>
Tell a made up story of how a bug coincided with Mercury being in retrograde.
The bug must be unique and interesting.
Do not talk about solutions.
The implication should be that the bug was a real thing, actually caused by Mercury being in retrograde.
We'll retain skeptics by documenting the operational timeline with enough specificity that the causal inference feels like a temptation, not a writer’s decree.
</NOTE>

### VI. The Crocodile in Vienna

<NOTE>
Tell a made up story of how a crocodile was spotted in Vienna, causing a stir among the locals and drawing attention from the authorities and impacting lifes of people in the city.
However, the crocodile had no impact on American software systems, which continued to operate as normal (different continent, get it?).

### VII. A Natural, Boring Crash

<FIXME>
Change the title to something more evocative.
</FIXME>

<NOTE>
Tell a made up story of how a server crashed due to environmental reasons, such as overheating or power failure.
The story should emphasize that this is not a supernatural event, but rather a mundane one.
This is a necessary palate cleanser, it shores up our credibility by reminding readers that not all anomalies are numinous.
