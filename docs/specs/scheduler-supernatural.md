# Classification of Supernatural Phenomena — Field Notes

*From the notebook of an investigator <PLACEHOLDER>*

---

## Prologue

I was not trained for hauntings. I was trained for reproducibility, for test plans and postmortems, for the clean relief of a failing unit test that fails again in the same way. But the longer I have tended systems—their valves and logs, their hissing racks and their fragile promises—the more I have come to understand that what we write on paper is not what the air will carry.

<PLACEHOLDER>

I began to keep a dossier. Not a taxonomy—God preserve me from one more axis—but a sheaf of field notes: cases gathered from labs and basements, control rooms and attics <PLACEHOLDER>. A few I saw myself; others I learned from steadier hands who were there before me <PLACEHOLDER>.

<PLACEHOLDER>

<NICE TO HAVES>
"The spec said: if due then run. The night said: if due then perhaps, if the moon consents."
"People ask if I believe in such things."
"Read them so that when the world leans on your specification, you recognize the weight."

## Case Files

### I. The Schaerbeek Bit

<FIXME>
Change the title to something more evocative.
</FIXME>

**Schaerbeek, Belgium, May 2003.**

<PLACEHOLDER>
<NOTE>
Tell a made-up story of how this happened.
Then follow up with the documented part - how it was investigated and what the conclusion was.
But the main piece is the made-up horror story.
</NOTE>

<NICE TO HAVES>
"The committee’s report is less romantic, but it permits the word that haunts this dossier: likely. A likely single-event upset—an ion that fell through the evening and made a number grow teeth."
"[poureva.be][2]"

An allegory that compares the unpredictability of software behavior to the weather. Something like "we do not fight the weather, we prepare for it."
</NICE TO HAVES>

### II. Mark II Moth

**Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1947.**

There is a photograph I keep in a folder called *Proofs I Do Not Argue With*. In it, a moth—an ordinary, grieving moth—sits dead-eyed on rag paper.

![Moth](https://ids.si.edu/ids/deliveryService?id=NMAH-NMAH2000-03035)

<PLACEHOLDER>

<NOTE>
Tell a made-up story of how this moth made something go wrong.
Implicit supernatural event is that it got there and caused mischief.
</NOTE>

<PLACEHOLDER>

I have stood before the display and seen my own face in the glass, a later child of their superstition: that if we name it, we can banish it. The moth looks unconvinced. ([National Museum of American History][1])

### III. The Heisenbug I Failed to Catch

<FIXME>
Change the title to something more evocative.
</FIXME>

<NOTE>
It would be nice to link to an actual report of someone who noticed an interesting or unique Heisenbug and how they diagnosed it. The story should then just be a retelling of that, with some embellishment. The story should not end with fixing the bug - it should portray the bug as something **real**, some kind of metaphysical phenomena that makes the system misbehave when it is not being observed.
</NOTE>

**Somewhere between midnight and the first ferry.**



<NICE TO HAVES>
"With strace running, it behaved as if repentant"
"I introduced print statements as if soothing a friend — *tell me what you are thinking when you do this*."
"We laid snares: printf incantations, timeouts shaved to angel-hair, a tracer that has broken better men than me."
"In the morning, I wrote my note: *This thing hates to be watched*."
</NICE TO HAVES>

### IV. Maxwell’s Demon, Junior Admin

**Staging cluster, autumn.**
We had a configuration that refused to stay put. A file that grew a line the way hair grows a whisper above the ear. We locked the directory. We set knobs in places documentation never intended them to be set. The change still crept in when the racks cooled and the day shift went home.

We performed ritual audits with the seriousness of municipal inspectors. We found nothing but our own reflection in the glass. Entropy does not do favors, an old physicist told me once. But what if, I asked and did not say, something in the room is letting the hot and cold pass on the nod? What if there is a small clerk in there, opening and closing a door for packets as if they were molecules? We set a watch on the process that had always pleaded innocence; at 02:11 it confessed by omission—its parent whispered a change and went back to sleep. A misconfigured agent, a token minted with too much trust, the neat trick by which a system eats its own law. We fixed it, but I still lock the cabinet twice.

### V. The Leprechaun of Off-by-One

<NOTE>
Tell a made up story of how actual Leprechaun from Irish folklore broke into the server room at night and "moved the loop bounds" (loop as in "a for-loop") by one.

This should be a story told to us by as a legend. In that legend, somebody allegedly, saw an actual small man in green clothes with a red beard in the server room.
</NOTE>

### VI. Ghost Passing Through the Machine

**The lab, on the midnight side of Sunday.**
There is a hush to phosphor light when the rest of the building has gone to sleep. The oscilloscope’s green line walked as if it were a man made to pace in a narrow cell. Every thirteen minutes, a ripple would pass through the chain and leave the board a degree warmer, the way grief rises in the body without reason.

We named candidates like saints: EMI from the elevator motor on the other side of the wall; a fridge cycling in a kitchenette that did not admit it had a fridge; even the thin-boned graduate student who insisted on wearing a wool sweater that snapped and sparked when he frowned. Nothing held until we found the power strip that was not ours, plugged into a socket it had no right to love, sharing a neutral with an antiquated lamp whose pull-chain had lost its temper years ago. We replaced it with something that had a ground like a promise. The ghost left, which does not mean it was not a ghost.

---

### VII. Mercury in Retrograde

**A superstition kept by sober men.**
I do not consult the heavens. But I have stood at the whiteboard as a team lead, normally immune to charms, circled three weeks on the calendar and called them a “soft freeze.” In the room nobody nodded. In the hallway they were grateful. It is unfashionable to say that correlation sometimes buys you a night’s sleep, but we live in unfashionable hours. The deploys we kept back did no harm by waiting. The ones we pushed in that window—when we had to—taught us humility quicker than postmortems can.

A young colleague left a note on my desk: “You don’t believe in planets.” I wrote back, “I believe in people who do.”

*Interlude, in ballpoint on a coffee-stained index card:*
“FIELD NOTE #7: Operations is the art of triage. Anything that keeps the patient breathing is, in a sense, science.”

---

### VIII. The Crocodile in Vienna

**Vienna, a summer you remember only for the heat.**
The calls came in as calls do: urgent, then sheepish, then embarrassed. There was a crocodile on the loose near the Danube, said an old friend who runs a respectable office of respectable people who do not welcome crocodiles to their commute. He wanted to know if any of our systems would notice. I looked at the monitors—the calm river of telemetry, the small and specific madnesses that make up an ordinary day—and felt for the first time a mercy I did not expect: nothing on our boards cared. A crocodile in Vienna is an event of supreme importance to neighbors and dogs and certain children who will never again look at water the same way. To our deployment pipeline it is a story told at lunch and then set gently back on the table. (Mock citation: *Municipal Safety Ledger, Wien, “Unverified Animal Sightings,” fol. 11.*)

*Interlude, fluorescent label on a spare drive:*
“IF FOUND, RETURN TO WHOEVER LOOKS TIRED.”

---

### IX. Non-Example Case Study: Crash

**The dust, the rail, and the unromantic truth.**
By the second week of the heat wave the server room had the thickness of a bakery. We set alarms more out of courtesy than hope. At 15:07 the GPU’s fan crossed from complaint to confession. The board throttled and then, as if persuaded by an older gravity, slowed to a stutter. Traces spooled like thread you can no longer catch. In the control room, the graphs polite-shrugged down toward zero and our own voices got too clean.

We pulled the host from the rack with the neatness of paramedics. The cover slid back to reveal the animal pelt: dust knotted into corrugations that remembered seasons of cleaning that did not come. Compressed air raised a cloud fossils would have envied. The fan, once freed, spun like a child proves a point. We replaced it anyway, because trust is a diminishing resource.

Then the other truth. On the floor, the UPS was doing sums badly. A sag in the rail, a power event with a shape we only infer from the way logs lose speech. The facility manager—a good man whose responsibilities always outnumber his hours—stood with his cap in his hand and said all the things a manager says when the grid, which is another man’s problem, makes itself yours. We moved the rack to a line with a better temper. The incident notes read like catechism: clogged intake, thermal throttling, rail instability, automatic shutdown. No demon, no poetry. An environment event, from toe to crown.

We wrote a calm postmortem. We replaced filters on a schedule whose pedantry I refuse to apologize for. We had a meeting about how the word “crash” should not scare us into seeing ghosts. Later, in a different month, at a different hour, I found myself reading those same notes like a charm against the other entries in this dossier. Not all dread belongs to the old gods. Some belongs to sweeping, and to budgets.

**Sidebar — Why Crash is environment, not supernatural**
A crash sits outside the story we tell about uncanny interference. It is the body of the system—its air, power, temperature—intervening with a logic so blunt it does not need to be mysterious. We can measure a clogged intake. We can watch a power rail bow. We can write protections into our procedures and, crucially, test them. The crash belongs to the weather *inside* the data center, not to the creatures that lean in from the dark. Treat it with respect; never mistake it for a visitation.

## Coda

I have gone through drawers in obsolete furniture to find these notes. Half the stories can be corrected by a man with a broom or a bonding strap. The other half sit in a corner of the room we never quite renovate, no matter how much new equipment arrives: the part where we admit that electronics are not only mechanisms but also places. Places where air moves, where people grow tired and superstition becomes a kind of compassion, where particles fall uninvited, where time itself seems to breathe on the glass and leave a film.

This is not a call to abandon specifications. It is an invitation to carry them like maps in mountains where the paths move. We live by the text; we survive by the small, retold stories that help us decide which part of the text applies when the world grows strange. If you keep a dossier of your own, write in a hand you will recognize when you are older. Tape in what must be taped. Leave space in the margins for the things we still do not know how to name.

## Case Files

### I. The Paper Moth

**Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1947.**
The room smelt of varnish and warm lacquer, the way relay contacts do when they have been clicking all afternoon. Someone had kept a logbook with the tidy penmanship of people who trust paper more than they trust memory. The entry is plain: a fault, a trace through the system, a relay standing proud in the light. Then a laugh that isn’t a laugh. They pried open the panel and there, splayed like a martyred ornament, lay a moth.

They taped it in—an act at once tender and prosecutorial—and wrote what they must have known was a little funny and a little true: “First actual case of bug being found.” The line survives, as does the insect, sepia beneath adhesive, held in the careful custody of a museum that understands the difference between myth and evidence. I have stood before the display and seen my own face in the glass, a later child of their superstition: that if we name it, we can banish it. The moth looks unconvinced. ([National Museum of American History][1])

*Interlude, taped to a rack unit:*
“FIELD NOTE #1: The instrument remembers. Keep paper.”

### II. The Schaerbeek Bit

**Schaerbeek, Belgium, May 2003.**
A municipal hall with tile floors polished to a civic shine. The counting machines had the decency to hum. It should have been an evening of tallies that fit in the columns prepared for them. Instead, the clerk called for a chair. And another, and another, until a committee of human bodies formed around a number that would not stay within its bounds.

A candidate had received more votes than the sheet said existed. The rest of the room retained its sanity; only one total bulged like a pocket knife. They ran it again. They ran it differently. They ran it with the light on and with the light off, and then, when obliged, with witnesses. The shape of the error was an old one wearing a modern coat: the spare grace of a single bit where none should be, at position thirteen. There is a tenderness, almost, to the phrase “spontaneous creation of a bit.” The committee’s report is less romantic, but it permits the word that haunts this dossier: likely. A likely single-event upset—an ion that fell through the evening and made a number grow teeth. The recount gave the missing votes back to the universe, which has never promised to keep them. ([poureva.be][2])

*Interlude, underlined twice:*
“FIELD NOTE #2: Cosmic weather is still weather. Bring a coat. Bring two.”

### III. The Heisenbug I Failed to Catch

**Somewhere between midnight and the first ferry.**
The process crashed like a polite animal—only when I looked away. Under observation it simpered and held. The moment I cleared the logging, it raked the filesystem as if by malice. I sat there in the glass aquarium we call an operations center, wrapped in a blanket that had seen too many interns and too few laundries, and learned a new kind of fatigue: the kind where you hear your own keystrokes as if they belong to someone older.

We laid snares: printf incantations, timeouts shaved to angel-hair, a tracer that has broken better men than me. Nothing. And then, at 04:23, with the monitor dimmed and my eyes closed against the tender ache behind them, it did the thing in the silence. A race, we later called it. But to me it will always be the hour when I realized some creatures can only be seen in the corner of the eye. (Mock citation: *Ward, L., “On the Vanishing Fault,” private notebook, undated.*)

*Interlude, scrawled in dull pencil:*
“FIELD NOTE #3: Some phenomena demand that you stop looking. Pray your pager agrees.”

### IV. Maxwell’s Demon, Junior Admin

**Staging cluster, autumn.**
We had a configuration that refused to stay put. A file that grew a line the way hair grows a whisper above the ear. We locked the directory. We set knobs in places documentation never intended them to be set. The change still crept in when the racks cooled and the day shift went home.

We performed ritual audits with the seriousness of municipal inspectors. We found nothing but our own reflection in the glass. Entropy does not do favors, an old physicist told me once. But what if, I asked and did not say, something in the room is letting the hot and cold pass on the nod? What if there is a small clerk in there, opening and closing a door for packets as if they were molecules? We set a watch on the process that had always pleaded innocence; at 02:11 it confessed by omission—its parent whispered a change and went back to sleep. A misconfigured agent, a token minted with too much trust, the neat trick by which a system eats its own law. We fixed it, but I still lock the cabinet twice.

### V. The Leprechaun of Off-by-One

**Warehouse-turned-office, winter.**
The loops in our overnight job were as old as the building’s timbers. At 23:58 the logs began, at 00:00 they closed, and the city woke to fresh tables as regular as parish bells. Then one morning the reports looked as if they had been boiled. Off by one day, one unit, one row in every hundred shaved to a smoothness that made the finance team go pale.

Someone had moved the bounds, the way an old story says that sprites move fences in the night so that travelers enter other countries by mistake. The change was nowhere in the repository. Branches denied it with cool, Protestant vigor. Yet the runtime plainly behaved as if the less-than had become less-than-or-equal. I found it, at last, in a caret someone had lifted and placed down one character to the right in a patch that was never reviewed because it was never, formally, made. “How?” asked my manager, a decent person who did not deserve this. “By hand,” I said, and shook my head at the window. (Mock citation: *“Concerning Bounds,” Folklore of the Build, chap. 2.*)

*Interlude, clipped from a manual and taped crooked:*
“WARNING: Changing time-zone settings during operation may lead to undefined behavior.” No one ever believes them when they try to be kind.

There is a hush to phosphor light when the rest of the building has gone to sleep. The oscilloscope’s green line walked as if it were a man made to pace in a narrow cell.
