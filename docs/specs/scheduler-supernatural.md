# Classification of Supernatural Phenomena — Field Notes

*From the notebook of an investigator <PLACEHOLDER/>*

---

## Prologue

I was not trained for hauntings. I was trained for reproducibility, for test plans and postmortems, for the clean relief of a failing unit test that fails again in the same way. But the longer I have tended systems—their valves and logs, their hissing racks and their fragile promises—the more I have come to understand that what we write on paper is not what the air will carry.

<PLACEHOLDER/>

I began to keep a dossier. Not a taxonomy—God preserve me from one more axis—but a sheaf of field notes: cases gathered from labs and basements, control rooms and attics <PLACEHOLDER/>. A few I saw myself; others I learned from steadier hands who were there before me <PLACEHOLDER/>.

"The spec said: if due then run. The night said: if due then perhaps, if the moon consents."
"People ask if I believe in such things."
"Read them so that when the world leans on your specification, you recognize the weight."

## Case Files

### I. The Schaerbeek Bit

<FIXME>
Change the title to something more evocative.
</FIXME>

**Schaerbeek, Belgium, May 2003.**

<PLACEHOLDER/>
<NOTE>
Tell a made-up story of how this happened.
Then follow up with the documented part - how it was investigated and what the conclusion was.
But the main piece is the made-up horror story.
</NOTE>

<NICE TO HAVES>
"... a carpet whose pattern is an argument against democracy..."
"He worked elections—“not politics,” he said quickly, “interfaces.”"
"... a habit of tapping the table as though confirming liveness."
"There is the certainty, never admitted aloud, that somewhere a check is missing and that this is sane; that checks go missing the way buttons go missing from coats."
"The woman with the tape asked if lightning could do it. “Not tonight,” said the toolbox man; “tonight is dry.”"
"The committee’s report is less romantic, but it permits the word that haunts this dossier: likely. A likely single-event upset—an ion that fell through the evening and made a number grow teeth."
"[poureva.be][2]"
"... if you believe in preparation, then you believe in a cathedral of checks where each arch braces another—triplicate logic, parity with scrubbing, watchdogs to guard the watchdogs, and the prophylactic act of voting in paper because paper fails like a person fails, slow and legible. But we persist in putting faith into boxes that hum, because the boxes are fast, and the public hungers for grace that arrives within the hour."

An allegory that compares the unpredictability of software behavior to the weather. Something like "we do not fight the weather, we prepare for it."

### II. Mark II Moth

**Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1947.**

There is a photograph I keep in a folder called *Proofs I Do Not Argue With*. In it, a moth—an ordinary, grieving moth—sits dead-eyed on rag paper.

![Moth](https://ids.si.edu/ids/deliveryService?id=NMAH-NMAH2000-03035)

<PLACEHOLDER/>

<NOTE>
Tell a made-up story of how this moth made something go wrong.
Implicit supernatural event is that it got there and caused mischief.
</NOTE>

<PLACEHOLDER/>

I have stood before the display and seen my own face in the glass, a later child of their superstition: that if we name it, we can banish it. The moth looks unconvinced. ([National Museum of American History][1])

### III. The Heisenbug I Failed to Catch

<FIXME>
Change the title to something more evocative.
</FIXME>

<NOTE>
It would be nice to link to an actual report of someone who noticed an interesting or unique Heisenbug and how they diagnosed it. The story should then just be a retelling of that, with some embellishment. The story should not end with fixing the bug - it should portray the bug as something **real**, some kind of metaphysical phenomena that makes the system misbehave when it is not being observed.
</NOTE>

**Somewhere between midnight and the first ferry.**



<NICE TO HAVES>
"With strace running, it behaved as if repentant"
"I introduced print statements as if soothing a friend — *tell me what you are thinking when you do this*."
"We laid snares: printf incantations, timeouts shaved to angel-hair, a tracer that has broken better men than me."
"In the morning, I wrote my note: *This thing hates to be watched*."
</NICE TO HAVES>

### IV. Maxwell’s Demon

<NOTE>
Tell a made up story about a state that is extremely unlikely, though possible, to happen, but did happen. 
For example, an MD5 hash collision.

Then, add a legend that one of the developers saw a large, terrifying demon that appeared to him in a dream, and that demon told him that the server room is cursed.

Ideally, find a real world example of something extremely unlikely happening, and use that as the basis for the story.
 </NOTE>

---

### V. The Leprechaun of Off-by-One

<NOTE>
Tell a made up story of how actual Leprechaun from Irish folklore broke into the server room at night and "moved the loop bounds" (loop as in "a for-loop") by one.

This should be a story told to us by as a legend. In that legend, somebody allegedly, saw an actual small man in green clothes with a red beard in the server room.
</NOTE>

---

### VI. Ghost Passing Through the Machine

<NOTE>
Tell a made up story of how some kind of ghost or spirit was causing interference in the server room, causing random electromagnetic interference that caused servers to misbehave.
It "spooked" transistors, causing them to misbehave.
</NOTE>

---

### VII. Mercury in Retrograde

<NOTE>
Tell a made up story of how a bug coincided with Mercury being in retrograde.
The bug must be unique and interesting.
Do not talk about solutions.
The implication should be that the bug was a real thing, actually caused by Mercury being in retrograde.
</NOTE>

---

### VIII. The Crocodile in Vienna

<NOTE>
Tell a made up story of how a crocodile was spotted in Vienna, causing a stir among the locals and drawing attention from the authorities and impacting lifes of people in the city.
However, the crocodile had no impact on American software systems, which continued to operate as normal (different continent, get it?).
</NOTE>

---

### IX. Non-Example Case Study: Crash

<FIXME>
Change the title to something more evocative.
</FIXME>

<NOTE>
Tell a made up story of how a server crashed due to environmental reasons, such as overheating or power failure.
The story should emphasize that this is not a supernatural event, but rather a mundane one.
</NOTE>

---

## Coda

<PLACEHOLDER/>

<NICE TO HAVES>
Something with the same moral as "We live by the text; we survive by the small, retold stories that help us decide which part of the text applies when the world grows strange. If you keep a dossier of your own, write in a hand you will recognize when you are older. Tape in what must be taped. Leave space in the margins for the things we still do not know how to name."
</NICE TO HAVES>
