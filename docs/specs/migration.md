# Incremental Graph Migration

This document describes the **migration system** for upgrading incremental-graph database state between application versions.

> Note: this migration flow always performs a replica cutover on success. Even
> when node values appear unchanged, migrations still bump `meta/version`, so
> there is no no-op replica-switch optimization in the migration path.

## Overview

When the application version changes, any computed values stored in the previous version's namespace may become stale or structurally incompatible with the new schema.  The migration system provides a strict, fail-fast API—`MigrationStorage`—that lets migration authors:

* **read** old values,
* **decide** what happens to each previously-materialized node (keep, override, invalidate, or delete),
* **traverse** the previous version's dependency graph.

A failed migration never activates the target replica.  Failures before unification leave the target replica untouched.  Failures after unification may leave the inactive replica written, but the active replica remains unchanged.

## Concepts

### Migration scope `S`

`S` is the set of all nodes materialized in the previous version. A node is materialized if and only if its identifier exists in `identifiers_keys_map`, `values`, `freshness`, and `timestamps`. A fresh node has freshness `"up-to-date"`; a stale node has freshness `"potentially-outdated"`.

After the user-supplied migration callback returns, **every node in `S` must have exactly one decision**.  Missing decisions cause `UndecidedNodesError`.

### Previous-version graph edges

Traversal helpers expose dependency metadata derived from durable graph metadata:

* Dependencies are derived from the stored graph scheme and identifiers lookup.
* `listValidDependents(N)` — nodes in `valid[N]` (outgoing validity frontier).

Traversal never re-executes computors; it derives dependency edges from `global/graph_scheme` and `identifiers_keys_map`.

## `MigrationStorage` API

All methods are `async`.

### Decision methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `get(nodeIdentifier)` | Return the previous-version value. |
| `keep(nodeIdentifier)` | Preserve node as-is in the new version. |
| `override(nodeIdentifier, value)` | Rewrite an existing cached value with the result of `value(nodeIdentifier)` (a `NodeIdentifier => Promise<ComputedValue>`), while preserving its cache-state proof envelope. |
| `invalidate(nodeIdentifier)` | Mark the node for recomputation. |
| `delete(nodeIdentifier)` | Remove the node from the new version entirely. |
| `create(nodeKeyString, value, freshness)` | Create a new cached node (not in the previous version) in the new schema with the result of `value(nodeIdentifier)` (a `NodeIdentifier => Promise<ComputedValue>`) as its initial value. `freshness` must be `"up-to-date"` or `"potentially-outdated"`. `nodeKeyString` is a `NodeKeyString` — the semantic key by which the node will be identified in the new schema. A fresh `NodeIdentifier` is allocated automatically. |

### Traversal methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `has(nodeIdentifier)` | `true` if `nodeIdentifier ∈ S`. |
| `listMaterializedNodes()` | `AsyncIterable<NodeIdentifier>` of all nodes in `S`. |
| Dependency inspection | Derived from the stored graph scheme and identifiers lookup. |
| `listValidDependents(nodeIdentifier)` | Previous-version validity frontier (returns `NodeIdentifier[]`). |
| `resolveNodeKey(nodeIdentifier)` | Resolve a `NodeIdentifier` to the parsed semantic `NodeKey` used by the previous replica, if available. |

## Decision rules

### Idempotency

Calling the same decision twice (except for `override` and `create`) is allowed and has no effect.

### Conflict detection

* Calling **different** decisions on the same node throws `DecisionConflictError`.
* Calling `override()` more than once on the same node throws `OverrideConflictError`.
* Calling `create()` twice on the same node throws `DecisionConflictError`.
* Calling `create()` on a node that exists in the previous version throws `CreateExistingNodeError`.

### Schema compatibility

`keep`, `override`, `invalidate`, and `create` check that the node's functor and arity exist in the new schema.  Incompatible nodes must be explicitly `delete`d.  Violation throws `SchemaCompatibilityError`.

### Operation semantics

`keep` preserves the value, freshness, timestamps, and compatible validity.

`override` is a **semantic-preserving representation rewrite**. It changes the stored representation (e.g. on-disk format) while preserving the semantic value as seen by dependents. Because the value is semantically unchanged, `override()` does not propagate invalidation — it inherits freshness, timestamps, and validity from the old record.

`override()` MUST NOT be used when the migration changes the meaning or value of a node. If the value itself changes, use `invalidate()` instead, which triggers downstream recomputation so that dependents observe the new value.

The intended use case is format migration: the database version changes the serialization format but the represented value is still meaningfully the same value. In that scenario missing invalidation in `override()` is correct by design — not a bug.

`invalidate` preserves the cached value if it exists, marks cached nodes as `"potentially-outdated"`, preserves `modifiedAt`, and does not preserve incoming or outgoing valid flags for the invalidated node. This is a conservative/hard invalidation: the clean-cache claim for the node is withdrawn.

`create(..., "up-to-date")` is a clean-cache assertion. The migration validates this assertion before writing the migrated state.
`create(..., "potentially-outdated")` seeds a cached value without claiming it is clean.

### Propagation rules

#### INVALIDATE → propagate INVALIDATE downstream

When a node is invalidated, all its dependents are automatically marked `INVALIDATE` (recursively), unless they are already `DELETE`d.  If a dependent already has a `KEEP` or `OVERRIDE` decision, `DecisionConflictError` is thrown immediately.

#### DELETE → propagate DELETE downstream (deferred, dependency-closed)

DELETE propagation runs at finalization (after the callback returns), via a BFS over dependents. One deleted input is sufficient to delete an undecided dependent, and that deletion propagates through every transitive materialized dependent.

This preserves the materialization invariant that every materialized node has all of its concrete inputs materialized. If a dependent already has an explicit `KEEP`, `OVERRIDE`, or `INVALIDATE` decision, `DecisionConflictError` is thrown.

---

## Error types

| Error class | When thrown |
|-------------|------------|
| `DecisionConflictError` | Two different decisions assigned to the same node. |
| `OverrideConflictError` | `override()` called more than once on the same node. |
| `CreateExistingNodeError` | `create()` called for a node that already exists in the previous version. |
| `UndecidedNodesError` | Some nodes in `S` have no decision after the callback. |
| `SchemaCompatibilityError` | `keep`/`override`/`invalidate`/`create` on a node absent from the new schema. |
| `InvalidMigrationDecisionError` | `override` or `create` called without the cache-state proof required by its API. |
| `GetMissingNodeError` | `get()`/traversal called for a node not in `S`. |
| `MissingDependencyMetadataError` | A materialized node has missing or corrupted dependency metadata. |

## Running a migration

Use `runMigration()` from the `incremental_graph` module:

```js
const { runMigration } = require('./generators/incremental_graph');

await runMigration(rootDatabase, newVersionNodeDefs, async (storage) => {
    for await (const nodeIdentifier of storage.listMaterializedNodes()) {
        // Decide what to do with each node
        if (shouldKeep(nodeIdentifier)) {
            await storage.keep(nodeIdentifier);
        } else {
            await storage.delete(nodeIdentifier);
        }
    }
});
```

`runMigration` will:

1. Detect the previous version by examining stored schema namespaces.
2. Create a `MigrationStorage` backed by the previous version's data.
3. Execute the callback.
4. Call `finalize()` internally (propagate deletes, check completeness).
5. Apply all decisions **atomically** to the new version's storage.

If no previous version is found, the migration is a no-op.

---

## Atomicity guarantee

Decisions are collected in memory during the callback.  The desired state is unified into the target replica's storage, then validated with `assertValidFinalMergeState` before the replica pointer is switched.  A failed migration never activates the target replica.  Failures before unification leave the target replica untouched.  Failures after unification may leave the inactive replica written, but the active replica remains unchanged.

## Strong invalidation validity semantics

Invalidation revokes validity proofs and therefore implies recomputation before an affected materialized node can become up-to-date again. Freshness records whether a materialized node may return immediately: an `up-to-date` node may return its cached value, while a `potentially-outdated` node pulls its dependencies and invokes its computor with the cached value as `oldValue`.

The `valid` relation is not a stale-cache reuse predicate. An incoming edge `valid[D].has(N)` is a proof required for `N` to be up-to-date. An outgoing set `valid[N]` is the proof frontier consumed by invalidation propagation.

Explicit invalidation of `N` marks `N` potentially-outdated, removes every incoming proof from each structural input into `N`, and consumes `N`'s outgoing validity frontier. Propagated invalidation removes the causal proof or proofs by which invalidation reached the dependent, marks the dependent potentially-outdated, and consumes that dependent's outgoing frontier. In diamonds, edge processing is separate from node expansion, so every causal edge is removed even if a downstream node is expanded only once.

A stale materialized node has no outgoing validity proofs. A stale non-source node lacks at least one incoming structural proof. Synchronization and migration preserve cached values but must not mint replacement proofs for invalidated nodes; their final replicas must satisfy the same strong-invalidation invariants before cutover.
